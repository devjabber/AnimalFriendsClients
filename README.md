# AnimalFriendsClients

This application was developed using Angular. Boostrap was used to keep the UI looking reasonably clean. Ag-Grid is the grid control.

Please run the following npm commands when running the site for the first time to install dependencies and start the site.

```
    npm install
    npm start
```    

The angular code runs on port 4200 as normal.
